# My Theme script for gnome 42 

This script is specfically for the gnome desktop environment and only the gnome desktop environment 

# prequisites

make sure to create a .icons directory and a .themes directory 





# How to use this script 

This script is prettt easy and simple to use all you need to do is git clone this repo 

Then make sure this script is executable by doing 

chmod +x theme.sh

also unlike my previous scripts you do not need to use sudo to run this script it is that simple 

all you need to do is run this command 

./theme.sh

then you will have my themes 


# Enjoy :)
